    <p>Beelzebub (/biːˈɛlzɪbʌb/ bee-EL-zi-bub or /ˈbiːlzɪbʌb/ BEEL-zi-bub; Hebrew: בַּעַל זְבוּב‎‎ Baʿal Zəḇūḇ) or Beelzebul is a name derived from a Philistine god, formerly worshipped in Ekron, and later adopted by some Abrahamic religions as a major demon. The name Beelzebub is associated with the Canaanite god Baal.</p>
    <p> In theological sources, predominantly Christian, Beelzebub is another name for Satan. He is known in demonology as one of the seven princes of Hell. The Dictionnaire Infernal describes Beelzebub as a being capable of flying, known as the "Lord of the Flyers", or the "Lord of the Flies"</p>
