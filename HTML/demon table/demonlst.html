        The Seven Princes of Hell, also known as the Seven Emperors of Hell or Seven Kings of Hell, are the highest authority in Hell even above the Ars Goetia and any other demon and fallen angel. Even though it is known as the "seven" princes, there had always been far more than seven.

    <h2>History</h2><hr/>
        <b>Fall from Grace</b><br/>
        The Seven Princes were originally high-ranking angels that resided within Heaven. During their time in Heaven they developed a camradere with one another and often bonded over certain topics during discussion. Due their high-ranking status amongst the angelic choir they were revered and praised with some even being chiefs of the choirs they were in.
    <br/>
    However, it was not until Lucifer declared war against the Almighty that they found themselves uniting as leading forces for the Morning Star's army of rebel angels. Each of the then-princes would rebel for their own personal reasons or beliefs although the only exception to that would be Belphegor as he chose neither God nor Lucifer's side during the rebellion. These seven rebel angels individually fought some of the mightiest angels only to fall to their power thus developing fiercely antagonistic relationships with said angels for eons to come.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Rulers of Hell</b><br/>
    The seven rebel angels were either horribly or even fatally injured during their violent battles against the archangels leaving scars on their bodies as a reminder of their sins as well as their hatred towards their respective enemy archangel. The first three to awaken from their impact in the Abyss were Lucifer, Beelzebub, and Samael and as such were regarded as the three most pivatol as well as most powerful monarchs that lord over the rebel angels. And due to the Seven being the first to land into the Abyss they would be chosen as the first rulers of said Abyss which became Hell from the effects of their impact.
    <br/>
    After awakening and recovering, the fallen angels decided they needed a form of ruling government in their new plane of existence. Some vied for power, but undoubtedly, the ruler of Hell at the time was the leader of the fallen angels, the charismatic Morning Star, Lucifer who established himself as the supreme soverign of Hell or emperor with Satan and Beelzebub close behind him. The other rebel angels that make up the Seven as a whole also became supreme rulers that lord over the other lesser nobles as well
    <br/>
    For centuries, Hell has been organized by Lucifer into the ruling body called the Seven Princes with him alongside Satan and Beelzebub forming the Satanic Triumvirate. Overtime, they grew strong and usurped dominion over all of lower planes with Lucifer and Satan being the true rulers whilst Beelzebub becomes second-in-command and is more or less an aid to the great fallen angels. Meanwhile the others would rule over different, vast areas of their lands. Each Prince was responsible for their own subjects and lands. Many enjoyed how organized this system was, though a select few hated being forced at the bottom for the others to be on top.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Corruption of Man</b><br/>
    As time would pass it was revealed that due to the nature and actions of the princes they begot the first sins that would plague mankind until the End of Days. As such, each of the Seven Princes became the physical representations of the Seven Deadly Sins. This in turn allowed them to mislead humanity into serving their twisted desires and turn them away from God and Heaven instead adding them to Hell's collection so as to use these damned souls for either their own gain or enroll them in Hell's legions during the final battle between Heaven and Hell.
    <br/>
    Several thousand years pass when Mundus, the son of Lucifer and Lilith, usurped his father's throne and replaced as the head prince amongst the Seven. The six other ruling kings found Mundus to be nothing more than a whiny and bratty child that muled over the expansion of his kingdom across all foreign realms despite the policy and treaties that were established between the Abrahamic Hell and the Hellenic underworlds. Regardless, the princes were given the oppertunity to truly plunge the world into darkness and sin and that was by the use of the Convergence.
    <br/>
    Mundus had Mulciber craft the Seven Gates of Hell across the seven continents of the world. The gates in question would act as conduits for the dimensional energy that would run amok through the main plane of reality, which in turn would allow the demons of Hell safe passage through the gates and unto the Earth. Furthermore, each of the princes would be positioned over their respective gates and given that they were across the seven points of the world would offer them more freedom to exert their influence across the planet. Because of the darkness they spread all manner of fiends, creatures of the night, and other abominations emerged from the darkest corners. Kingdoms fell into ruin, religious folk forsook their faith, alchemists went mad and so forth. That particular era was dubbed by scholars as the Dark Age.
